# SVG-to-TurtleStitch üê¢

A helper project to use SVG paths via a Google Spreadsheet in <a href="https://www.turtlestitch.org/">Turtle Stitch</a>.

## Outline

Turtle Stitch is excellent for creating both algorithmic and freeform patterns but generating precise, non-algorithmic designs can be challenging. To address this, I developed a workflow that allows you to design in a vector graphic tool like <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma </a> and export your creations as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</a>. The paths within the SVG can then be converted into an array of x- and y-coordinates, which can easily be copied to your clipboard and pasted into a Google Spreadsheet. This data can subsequently be imported into Turtle Stitch, enabling you to create custom embroidery designs.

### Disclaimer:

While using tools other than Figma or Google Spreadsheets is perfectly fine, this guide will specifically focus on the process as it relates to my particular setup at hand.

Feel free to let me know if you need any more adjustments!

### Creating a vector graphic (in Figma)
This guide won't cover how you use Figma as such, but will only focus on what to keep in mind when designing for Turtle Stitch.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure that the design you will export as SVG is not bigger than what your stitching machine can handle. In my case, I figured out that a design in Figma which is 900 x 650 pixels, will result in a stitching of 18 x 13cm (which is the maximum my machine can handle).
