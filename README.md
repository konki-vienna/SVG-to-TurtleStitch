# SVG-to-TurtleStitch üê¢

A helper project to use SVG paths via a Google Spreadsheet in <a href="https://www.turtlestitch.org/">Turtle Stitch</a>.

## Outline

Turtle Stitch is excellent for creating both algorithmic and freeform patterns, but generating precise, non-algorithmic designs can be challenging. To address this, I developed a workflow that allows you to design in a vector graphic tool like <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma </a> and export your creations as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</a>. The paths within the SVG can then be converted into an array of x- and y-coordinates, which can easily be copied to your clipboard and pasted into a Google Spreadsheet. This data can subsequently be imported into Turtle Stitch, enabling you to create custom embroidery designs.

### Disclaimer:

While using tools other than Figma or Google Spreadsheets is perfectly fine, this guide will specifically focus on the process as it relates to my particular setup at hand.
